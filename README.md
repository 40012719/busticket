# Introduction:


This is the project on the online ticketing system of express bus company, which in most cases; the company has problems with their ticketing and scheduling process. This project intends to computerize its semi computerized ticketing system to provide better customer service. Because of that, the company can provide the easier way of travelling to the customer or passenger. Electronic tickets, or e-tickets, give evidence that their holders have permission to enter a place of entertainment, use a means of transportation, or have access to some Internet services. Bus Ticket Reservation System enables the bus company's customer to buy bus ticket online. E-ticket is the easier and quickest way to take bus. The online system is a new system because it havens exists in bus company and even in Malaysia. Currently, staff at the bus ticket counter is using an internal system to sell ticket at the counter. Customer is unable to buy bus ticket online at this moment and must go to the counter to buy bus ticket. Sometimes, customer needs to queue up a long queue to buy bus ticket and ask for information. Besides that, customer also not allows buying bus ticket through telephone and Transnationalâ€™s telephone line is always busy.
